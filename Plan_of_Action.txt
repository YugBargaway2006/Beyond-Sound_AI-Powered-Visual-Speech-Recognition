# Beyond Sound: AI-Powered Visual Speech Recognition


## Plan of Action

1. Paper Reading
2. Complete base implementation and understanding.
3. Play with different architecture, models and fine tuning for numerical gain representation.
4. Add a custom next word predictor for better accuracy.
5. Optimise using TensorRT and ONNX.
6. Deploy in a web app using GitHub for free deployment.
7. Add custom video upload feature for exhaustive predictions.
8. Add webcam capabilities for final deployment.
9. Provide Train with your lips feature, but that would require a large amount of dataset from user end.  










## What is demonstrates?

1. Shows practical understanding of deep learning, CNNs + RNNs, and CTC loss.
2. Demonstrates experience in video processing, temporal modeling, and language understanding.
3. A web app on top gives a layer of usability and frontend/backend experience.

It's a known replication ‚Äî so unless you improved or extended it, reviewers may assume you just followed existing tutorials or GitHub repos.
Doesn‚Äôt immediately show innovation or creativity unless you personalize it or take it further.


## How to elevate it?

1. Benchmark & Improve:
Train LipNet on custom datasets (e.g., Hindi lip-reading or noisy datasets).
Try fine-tuning or transfer learning on your own speech video data.
Compare results to the original paper.

‚úÖ Resume phrasing:
Fine-tuned LipNet on custom Indian-accented dataset; achieved 87% accuracy (5% over baseline).


2. Add Multimodal Fusion
Add a custom built next word predictor using LSTM / RNN for audio dropout retrieval technique and handle noisy audio or audio dropout scenarios.

‚úÖ Resume phrasing:
Implemented audio-visual fusion to improve robustness of lip-reading under noisy environments.


3. Real-time Inference
Optimize the model for real-time lip-reading using TensorRT or ONNX.
Show latency numbers and optimization techniques.

‚úÖ Resume phrasing:
Converted LipNet model to real-time system using ONNX & WebRTC, achieving 30 FPS inference.


4. Deploy as Full-stack App
Frontend: Webcam-based live lip reading.
Backend: Model inference server (Flask/FastAPI).

Add a database of predictions or allow users to upload video for processing.

‚úÖ Resume phrasing:

Deployed end-to-end lip-reading web app using React + FastAPI; processed user webcam input in-browser.


üîπ 5. User Personalization
Let users train on their own lip data, making it personalized.

Add feature: ‚ÄúTrain with your lips ‚Äî accurate predictions just for you.‚Äù

‚úÖ Resume phrasing:

Enabled personalized lip reading by training user-specific models on uploaded video samples.


6. Research Extension
Propose or implement an improvement over LipNet ‚Äî e.g., use Transformers instead of RNNs, or try 3D CNNs.

Show experimental results.

‚úÖ Resume phrasing:

Replaced Bi-GRU with Transformer encoder; reduced Word Error Rate (WER) by 8%.


A straight LipNet implementation:

‚úÖ Good as a base.

‚ùå Not resume-brilliant alone.

To stand out, do one or more of:

Improve performance.

Extend the model.

Make it real-time + deploy it.

Add user personalization.

Solve real-world or accessibility problems.
